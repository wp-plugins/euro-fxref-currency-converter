Adds the [currency] and [currency_legal] shortcodes to convert currencies based on the ECB reference exchange rates.

== Description ==

Using the [currency] shortcode you can convert one currency to another. The conversion is based on the rates published by the ECB (updated daily between 2.15 p.m. and 3.00 p.m. CET).

You can change from and to any of the supported currencies.

The [currency_legal] shortcode outputs a disclaimer text and a link to the ECB eurofxref page.

This plugin is based on a plugin by [Xclamation](http://www.xclamationdesign.co.uk/free-currency-converter-shortcode-plugin-for-wordpress/).

* Uncompress it with your preferred unzip application

== Shortcode usage & examples ==

= currency_legal shortcode =
This shortcode returns the string '* For informational purposes only. Exchange rates may vary. Based on <a href="http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/" target="_blank">ECB reference rates</a>.'

The prepended '* ' (the same string as the [currency] append string) can be changed using the 'prepend' attribute.

For example: `[currency_legal prepend='Please note: ']`

The legal string can also be retrieved in PHP using `<?php echo EuroFxRef::legal_string( 'optional prepend string' ) ?>`

= currency shortcode =

* `from`: currency code (default: EUR)
* `to`: currency code (default: USD)
* `amount`: number of "from" currency (default: 1)
* `iso`: boolean (true or false, default false); use ISO currency
      formatting
* `show_from`: boolean (default true); show from amount in output
* `between`: string (default '&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;' which is displayed as 
      '&nbsp;/&nbsp;' in the browser); string between from and to amounts
* `append`: string (default '&amp;nbsp;*' which is displayed as '&nbsp;*' in
      the browser); string put after conversion. The * references the
      disclaimer text, see [currency_legal] shortcode.
* `round: boolean` (default true); Round numbers to whole units.
* `round_append`: string (default '='); replaces decimals
* `to_style`: css formatting text (default
      'cursor:help;border-bottom:1px dotted gray;'); styling of "to"
      text.

Conversion from non-Euro to non-Euro is done through the Euro, so GBP to USD is calculated as GBP -> EUR -> USD.

= Examples =
* `[currency amount="875" from="EUR" to="GBP"]` 
  becomes "€ 875,= / £ 697.= *"
* `[currency amount="875" from="GBP" to="USD" iso=true between=" converts to " append="" round_append=""]` 
  becomes "875 GBP converts to 1,418 USD"
* `[currency amount="875" from="GBP" to="USD" show_from=false round=false]` 
  becomes "$ 1,130.15 *"
